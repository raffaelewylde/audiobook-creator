splitter .split_documents (docs)
You’ve now gained the ability to craft an ef ficient data loading pipeline,
leveraging sources such as PDFs, CSVs, and Google Cloud Storage links.
Furthermore, you’ve learned how to enrich the collected documents with
relevant metadata, providing meaningful context for analysis and prompt
engineering.With the introduction of text splitters, you can now strategically manage
document sizes, optimizing for both the LLM’ s context window and the
preservation of context-rich information. You’ve navigated handling lar ger
texts by employing recursion and character splitting. This newfound
knowledge empowers you to work seamlessly with various document
sources and integrate them into a robust data pipeline.
Task Decomposition
Task decomposition  is the strategic process of dissecting complex problems
into a suite of manageable subproblems. This approach aligns seamlessly
with the natural tendencies of software engineers, who often conceptualize
tasks as interrelated subcomponents.
In software engineering, by utilizing task decomposition you can reduce
cognitive burden and harness the advantages of problem isolation and
adherence to the single responsibility principle.
Interestingly , LLMs stand to gain considerably from the application of task
decomposition across a range of use cases. This approach aids in
maximizing the utility and ef fectiveness of LLMs in problem-solving
scenarios by enabling them to handle intricate tasks that would be
challenging to resolve as a single entity , as illustrated in Figure 4-3 .
Here are several examples of LLMs using decomposition:Complex pr oblem solving
In instances where a problem is multifaceted and cannot be solved
through a single prompt, task decomposition is extremely useful. For
example, solving a complex legal case could be broken down into
understanding the case’ s context, identifying relevant laws,
determining legal precedents, and crafting ar guments. Each subtask
can be solved independentl
