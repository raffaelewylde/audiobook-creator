mbs-down rating system
If you run this in a Jupyter Notebook, a widget displays each AI response,
with a thumbs-up or thumbs-down button (see Figure 1-12 ) This provides a
simple interface for quickly labeling responses, with minimal overhead. If
you wish to do this outside of a Jupyter Notebook, you could change the
thumbs-up and thumbs-down emojis for Y and N, and implement a loop
using the built-in input()  function, as a text-only replacement for
iPyW idgets.Once you’ve finished labeling the responses, you get the output, which
shows you how each prompt performs.
Output:
A/B testing completed. Here's the results:
  variant  count  score
0       A      5    0.2
1       B      5    0.6
The dataframe was shuf fled at random, and each response was labeled blind
(without seeing the prompt), so you get an accurate picture of how often
each prompt performed. Here is the step-by-step explanation:
1. Three modules are imported: ipywidgets , IPython.display , and
pandas . ipywidgets  contains interactive HTML  widgets for
Jupyter Notebooks and the IPython kernel. IPython.display
provides classes for displaying various types of output like images,
sound, displaying HTML, etc. Pandas is a powerful data manipulation
library .
2. The pandas library is used to read in the CSV  file responses.csv , which
contains the responses you want to test. This creates a Pandas DataFrame
called df.
3. df is shuf fled using the sample()  function with frac=1 , which
means it uses all the rows. The reset_index(drop=True)  is used toreset the indices to the standard 0, 1, 2, … , n index.
4. The script defines response_index  as 0. This is used to track which
response from the dataframe the user is currently viewing.
5. A new column feedback  is added to the dataframe df with the data
type as str  or string.
6. Next, the script defines a function on_button_clicked(b) , which
will execute whenever one of the two buttons in the interface is clicked.
a. The function first checks the description
