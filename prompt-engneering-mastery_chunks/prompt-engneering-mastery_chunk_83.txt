In the context of prompt engineering, the sliding window approach of fers
several benefits over fixed chunking methods. It allows LLMs to retain a
higher degree of context, as there is an overlap between the chunks andoffers an alternative approach to preserving context compared to sentence
detection.
Text Chunking Packages
When working with LLMs such as GPT -4, always remain wary of the
maximum context length:
maximum_context_length = input_tokens +
output_tokens
There are various tokenizers available to break your text down into
manageable units, the most popular ones being NL TK, spaCy , and tiktoken.
Both NLTK and spaCy  provide comprehensive support for text processing,
but you’ll be focusing on tiktoken.
Text Chunking with Tiktoken
Tiktoken  is a fast byte pair encoding (BPE)  tokenizer that breaks down text
into subword units and is designed for use with OpenAI’ s models. Tiktoken
offers faster performance than comparable open source tokenizers.As a developer working with GPT -4 applications, using tiktoken of fers you
several key advantages:
Accurate token br eakdown
It’s crucial to divide text into tokens because GPT  models interpret
text as individual tokens. Identifying the number of tokens in your
text helps you figure out whether the text is too lengthy for a model
to process.
Effective r esour ce utilization
Having the correct token count enables you to manage resources
efficiently , particularly when using the OpenAI API. Being aware of
the exact number of tokens helps you regulate and optimize API
usage, maintaining a balance between costs and resource usage.
Encodings
Encodings define the method of converting text into tokens, with dif ferent
models utilizing dif ferent encodings. Ti
