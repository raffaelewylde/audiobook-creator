this book is on prompting techniques
rather than traditional coding skills. The code can all be found on GitHub ,
and we will link to the relevant notebooks throughout. It’ s highly
recommended that you utilize the GitHub repository  and run the provided
examples while reading the book.
For non-notebook examples, you can run the script with the format
python content/chapter_x/script.py  in your terminal, where x
is the chapter number and script.py  is the name of the script. In some
instances, API keys need to be set as environment variables, and we will
make that clear . The packages used update frequently , so install our
requir ements.txt  in a virtual environment before running code examples.
The requir ements.txt  file is generated for Python 3.9. If you want to use a
different version of Python, you can generate a new requir ements.txt  from
this requir ements.in  file found within the GitHub repository , by running
these commands:
`pip install pip-tools`
`pip-compile requirements.in`
For Mac users:
1. Open Terminal: You can find the Terminal application in your
Applications folder , under Utilities, or use Spotlight to search for it.2. Navigate to your project folder: Use the cd command to change the
directory to your project folder . For example: cd
path/to/your/project .
3. Create the virtual environment: Use the following command to create a
virtual environment named venv  (you can name it anything):
python3 -m venv venv .
4. Activate the virtual environment: Before you install packages, you need
to activate the virtual environment. Do this with the command source
venv/bin/activate .
5. Install packages: Now that your virtual environment is active, you can
install packages using pip . To install packages from the
requir ements.txt  file, use pip install -r requirements.txt .
6. Deactivate virtual environment: When you’re done, you can deactivate
the virtual environment by typing deactivate .
For Windows users:
1. Open Command Prompt: You can search for cmd
