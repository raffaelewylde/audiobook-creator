 means you
have the flexibility to store dif ferent components such as templates,
examples, and others in distinct files and reference them as required.
Let’s learn how to save and load prompts:
from langchain_core.prompts  import PromptTemplate , lo
prompt = PromptTemplate (
    template ='''Translate this sentence from English 
    \nSentence: {sentence} \nTranslation:''' ,
    input_variables =["sentence" ],
)
prompt.save("translation_prompt.json" )
# Loading the prompt template:load_prompt ("translation_prompt.json" )
# Returns PromptTemplate()
After importing PromptTemplate  and load_prompt  from the
langchain.prompts  module, you define a PromptTemplate  for
English-to-Spanish translation tasks and save it as translation_pr ompt.json .
Finally , you load the saved prompt template using the load_prompt
function, which returns an instance of PromptTemplate .
WARNING
Please be aware that LangChain’ s prompt saving may not work with all types of prompt templates.
To mitigate this, you can utilize the pickle  library or .txt files to read and write any prompts that
LangChain does not support.
You’ve learned how to create few-shot prompt templates using LangChain
with two techniques: a fixed number of examples and using an example
selector .
The former creates a set of few-shot examples and uses a
ChatPromptTemplate  object to format these into chat messages. This
forms the basis for creating a FewShotChatMessagePromptTemplate
object.The latter approach, using an example selector , is handy when user input
varies significantly in length. In such scenarios, a
LengthBasedExampleSelector  can be utilized to adjust the number of
examples based on user input length. This ensures your LLM does not
exceed its context window limit.
Moreover , you’ve seen how easy it is to store/load prompts as files,
enabling enhanced shareability , storage, and versioning.
Data Connection
Harnessing an LLM application, coupled with your data, uncovers a
plethora of opportunities to boost e
