investigate before continuing. If you’re still
not getting the right format back, it can help to specify at the beginning or
end of the prompt, or in the system message if using a chat model: You
are a helpful assistant that only responds in JSON , or
specify JSON output  in the model parameters where available (this is called
grammars  with Llama models .
TIP
To get up to speed on JSON if you’re unfamiliar , W3Schools has a good introduction .
For image generation models, format is very important, because the
opportunities for modifying an image are near endless. They range from
obvious formats like stock photo , illustration , and oil
painting , to more unusual formats like dashcam footage , ice
sculpture , or in Minecraft  (see Figure 1-7 ).
Input:
business meeting of four people watching on MacBook o
table, in Minecraft

When setting a format, it is often necessary to remove other aspects of the
prompt that might clash with the specified format. For example, if you
supply a base image of a stock photo, the result is some combination of
stock photo and the format you wanted. To some degree, image generation
models can generalize to new scenarios and combinations they haven’ t seenbefore in their training set, but in our experience, the more layers of
unrelated elements, the more likely you are to get an unsuitable image.
There is often some overlap between the first and second principles, Give
Direction and Specify Format. The latter is about defining what type of
output you want, for example JSON format, or the format of a stock photo.
The former is about the style of response you want, independent from the
format, for example product names in the style of Steve Jobs, or an image
of a business meeting in the style of Van Gogh. When there are clashes
between style and format, it’ s often best to resolve them by dropping
whichever element is less important to your final result.
