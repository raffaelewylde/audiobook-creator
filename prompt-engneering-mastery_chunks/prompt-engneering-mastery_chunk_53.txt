 OpenAI at the time of writing, with
its state-of-the-art GPT -4 model widely considered to have a significant
lead. The closest competitor is Anthropic, and there is widespread
excitement at the potential of smaller open source models such as Llama
and Mistral, particularly with respects to fine-tuning. Although
commentators expect OpenAI to continue to deliver world-beating models
in the future, as open source models get good enough  at more tasks, AI
workloads may shift toward local fine-tuned models. With advances in
model performance and quantization (methods for trading of f accuracy
versus size and compute cost), it may be possible to one day run LLMs on
your mobile phone or other devices.
For now , the best way to get a sense for what the models are good at is to
run the same prompt across multiple models and compare the responses.
One thing that regularly stands out in our work is that GPT -4 is much better
at following instructions, as is demonstrated in the following examplewhere it was the only model to respond in the right format, with names that
matched the examples (starting with the letter i), as desired.
Input:
