Output:
Based on these considerations, both MongoDB and Postg
strengths, but given the emphasis on strong data cons
querying, and data integrity constraints, PostgreSQL 
suitable choice for your project.
In this final example, the model uses the additional context provided to give
a well-informed recommendation for using PostgreSQL. By asking for
context when necessary , LLMs like ChatGPT  and GPT -4 can deliver more
valuable and accurate responses.
Figure 3-3  demonstrates how asking for context  changes the decision-
making process of LLMs. Upon receiving user input, the model first
assesses whether the context given is suf ficient. If not, it prompts the user to
provide more detailed information, emphasizing the model’ s reliance oncontext-rich inputs. Once adequate context is acquired, the LLM then
generates an informed and relevant response.

ALLOW THE LLM TO ASK FOR MORE CONTEXT BY DEFAULT
You can allow the LLM to ask for more context as a default by including this key phrase: If you need
more context, please specify what would help you to make a better decision.
