Several important points to note while function calling:
Itâ€™s possible to have many functions that the LLM can call.
OpenAI can hallucinate function parameters, so be more explicit within
the system  message to overcome this.
The function_call  parameter can be set in various ways:
To mandate a specific function call: tool_choice: {"type:
"function", "function": {"name": "my_function"}}} .
For a user message without function invocation: tool_choice:
"none" .
By default ( tool_choice: "auto" ), the model autonomously
decides if and which function to call.Parallel Function Calling
You can set your chat messages to include intents that request simultaneous
calls to multiple tools. This strategy is known as parallel function calling .
Modifying the previously used code, the messages  list is updated to
mandate the scheduling of two meetings:
