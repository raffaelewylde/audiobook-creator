Stable Dif fusion v1.5 (as many extensions are still only compatible with
this version), or Stable Dif fusion XL , and we specify the dif ferences when
this is important.
We provide examples using open source libraries wherever possible, though
we do include commercial vendors where appropriate—for example,
Chapter 5  on vector databases demonstrates both F AISS (an open source
library) and Pinecone (a paid vendor). The examples demonstrated in the
book should be easily modifiable for alternative models and vendors, and
the skills taught are transferable. Chapter 4  on advanced text generation is
focused on the LLM framework LangChain, and Chapter 9  on advanced
image generation is built on AUT OMA TIC1 111’s open source Stable
Diffusion Web UI.
