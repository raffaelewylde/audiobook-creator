But why not simply use an f-string  for prompt templating? Using
LangChain’ s prompt templates instead allows you to easily:
Validate your prompt inputs
Combine multiple prompts together with composition
Define custom selectors that will inject k-shot examples into your
prompt
Save and load prompts from .yml and .json  files
Create custom prompt templates that execute additional code or
instructions when created
LangChain Expression Language
(LCEL)
The | pipe operator is a key component of LangChain Expression
Language (LCEL) that allows you to chain together dif ferent components or
runnables  in a data processing pipeline.
In LCEL, the | operator is similar to the Unix pipe operator . It takes the
output of one component and feeds it as input to the next component in thechain. This allows you to easily connect and combine dif ferent components
to create a complex chain of operations:
chain = prompt | model
The | operator is used to chain together the prompt and model
components. The output of the prompt component is passed as input to the
model component. This chaining mechanism allows you to build complex
chains from basic components and enables the seamless flow of data
between dif ferent stages of the processing pipeline.
Additionally , the or der matters , so you could technically create this chain:
bad_order_chain  = model | prompt
But it would produce an error after using the invoke  function, because
the values returned from model  are not compatible with the expected
inputs for the prompt.
Let’s create a business name generator using prompt templates that will
return five to seven relevant business names:
from langchain_openai.chat_models  import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts  import (SystemMessageProm
ChatPromptTemplate )template  = """
