the intricate web of relationships that form language.
Transformer Architecture: Orchestrating
Contextual Relationships
Before we go deep into the mechanics of transformer architectures, let’ s
build a foundational understanding. In simple terms, when we have a
sentence, say , The cat sat on the mat , each word in this sentence getsconverted into its numerical vector representation. So, cat might become a
series of numbers, as does sat, on, and mat.
As you’ll explore in detail later in this chapter , the transformer architecture
takes these word vectors and understands their relationships—both in
structure (syntax) and meaning (semantics). There are many types of
transformers; Figure 2-2  showcases both BER T and GPT’ s architecture.
Additionally , a transformer doesn’ t just see words in isolation; it looks at
cat and knows it’ s related to sat and mat in a specific way in this sentence.Figure 2-2. BER T uses an encoder for input data, while GPT  has a decoder for outputWhen the transformer processes these vectors, it uses mathematical
operations to understand the relationships between the words, thereby
producing new vectors with rich, contextual information:
v′
i=Transformer(v1,v2,...,vm)
One of the remarkable features of transformers is their ability to
comprehend the nuanced contextual meanings of words. The self-attention
mechanism in transformers lets each word in a sentence look at all other
words to understand its context better . Think of it like each word casting
votes on the importance of other words for its meaning. By considering the
entire sentence, transformers can more accurately determine the role and
meaning of each word, making their interpr etations mor e contextually rich.
Probabilistic Text Generation: The Decision
Mechanism
After the transformer understands the context of the given text, it moves on
to generating new text, guided by the concept of likelihood or probabili
