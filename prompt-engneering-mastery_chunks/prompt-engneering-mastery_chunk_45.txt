was crucial for
generating outputs that were not just contextually accurate and fluent, but
also coherent over longer stretches.According to AI pioneer and educator Andrew Ng , much of the early NLP
research, including the fundamental work on transformers, received
significant funding from United States military intelligence agencies. Their
keen interest in tools like machine translation and speech recognition,
primarily for intelligence purposes, inadvertently paved the way for
developments that transcended just translation.
Training LLMs requires extensive computational resources. These models
are fed with vast amounts of data, ranging from terabytes to petabytes,
including internet content, academic papers, books, and more niche datasets
tailored for specific purposes. It’ s important to note, however , that the data
used to train LLMs can carry inher ent biases fr om their sour ces. Thus, users
should exercise caution and ideally employ human oversight when
leveraging these models, ensuring responsible and ethical AI applications.
OpenAI’ s GPT -4, for example, boasts an estimated 1.7 trillion parameters ,
which is equivalent to an Excel spreadsheet that stretches across thirty
thousand soccer fields. Parameters  in the context of neural networks are the
weights and biases adjusted throughout the training process, allowing the
model to represent and generate complex patterns based on the data it’ s
trained on. The training cost for GPT -4 was estimated to be in the order of
$63 million , and the training data would fill about 650 kilometers of
bookshelves full of books .To meet these requirements, major technological companies such as
Microsoft, Meta, and Google have invested heavily , making LLM
development a high-stakes endeavor .
The rise of LLMs has provided an increased demand for the hardware
industry , particularly companies specializing in graphics processing units
(GPUs). NVIDIA, for instance, has become almost synonymous with high-
performance GPUs tha
