  in the Start menu.
2. Navigate to your project folder: Use the cd command to change the
directory to your project folder . For example: cd
path\to\your\project .
3. Create the virtual environment: Use the following command to create a
virtual environment named venv : python -m venv venv .
4. Activate the virtual environment: To activate the virtual environment on
Windows, use .\venv\Scripts\activate .5. Install packages: With the virtual environment active, install the required
packages: pip install -r requirements.txt .
6. Deactivate the virtual environment: To exit the virtual environment,
simply type: deactivate .
Here are some additional tips on setup:
Always ensure your Python is up-to-date to avoid compatibility issues.
Remember to activate your virtual environment whenever you work on
the project.
The requir ements.txt  file should be in the same directory where you
create your virtual environment, or you should specify the path to it
when using pip install -r .
Access to an OpenAI developer account is assumed, as your
OPENAI_API_KEY  must be set as an environment variable in any
examples importing the OpenAI library , for which we use version 1.0.
Quick-start instructions for setting up your development environment can
be found in OpenAI’ s documentation  on their website.
You must also ensure that billing is enabled  on your OpenAI account and
that a valid payment method is attached to run some of the code within the
book. The examples in the book use GPT -4 where not stated, though we do
briefly cover Anthropic’ s competing Claude 3 model , as well as Meta’ s
open source Llama 3  and Google Gemini .For image generation we use Midjourney , for which you need a Discord
account to sign up, though these principles apply equally to DALL-E 3
(available with a ChatGPT  Plus subscription or via the API) or Stable
Diffusion (available as an API or it can run locally  on your computer if it
has a GPU). The image generation examples in this book use Midjourney
