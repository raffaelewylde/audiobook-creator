he
product (that they can fit any foot size). Remember, 
ratings are subjective and the ultimate success of a 
name also depends on the target market, branding, and
marketing efforts.
In running this multiple times, it consistently rates the name “OneSize
Glovewalkers” as the worst, providing context (if you ask) that the concept
might be confusing in a shoe context. You may be wondering why , if the
model knows  this is a bad name, does it suggest it in the first place? LLMs
work by predicting the next token in a sequence and therefore struggle to
know what the overall response will be when finished. However , when it
has all the tokens from a previous response to review , it can more easily
predict whether this would be labeled as a good or bad response.
We can continue to chain multiple calls together to improve the results of
our task. For example, we could split this into three separate ratings: clarity ,
memorability , and how well the name communicates the unique selling
point of the product. These ratings could then be given to a human asadditional context on the final decision, or even calculated together to select
the final name programmatically .
The real unlock in learning to work professionally with AI versus just
playing around with prompting is realizing that every part of the system can
be broken down into a series of iterative steps. Even with a single prompt
this principles applies, as simply appending Let's think step by
step  to the prompt can lead to demonstrable gains in reasoning and
proficiency , as well as provide an audit trail for quality assurance and
debugging. When taking the time and tokens to reason, the ratings change
and are more consistent with the scoring criteria.
