Summary
The journey of LLMs from their inception to their current advanced states
is a tale of relentless innovation, collaboration, and intense competition. As
these models continue to evolve, they are likely to become even more
integral parts of our daily lives, changing the way we interact with
technology and even with each other .By understanding the historical context and capabilities of these models,
you can better appreciate the tools at our disposal for various applications,
from prompt engineering to the development of intelligent virtual agents.
It’s important to note, however , that while these models of fer expansive
possibilities, data privacy remains a crucial concern. If these models use
your data for retraining or fine-tuning, exercise caution and refrain from
inputting sensitive information.
In the next chapter , you will learn all the basic prompt engineering
techniques for working with text LLMs. You’ll learn the essential skills
needed to get the most out of powerful language models like GPT -4.
Exciting insights and practical methods await you as you unlock the true
potential of generative AI.Chapter 3. Standard Practices for Text
Generation with ChatGPT
Simple prompting techniques will help you to maximize the output and
formats from LLMs. You’ll start by tailoring the prompts to explore all of
the common practices used for text generation.
Generating Lists
Automatically generating lists is incredibly powerful and enables you to
focus on higher -level tasks while GPT  can automatically generate, refine,
rerank, and de-duplicate lists on your behalf.
Input:
Generate a list of Disney characters.
Output:
Sure, here is a list of some popular Disney character
1. Mickey Mouse
2. Minnie Mouse...
30. Bagheera (The Jungle Book)
GPT-4 is perfectly capable of providing a list of characters. However , there
are some pitfalls with this approach:
