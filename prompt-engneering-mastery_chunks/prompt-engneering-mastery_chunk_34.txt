As you build out your prompt, you start to get to the point where you’re
asking a lot in a single call to the AI. When prompts get longer and more
convoluted, you may find the responses get less deterministic, and
hallucinations or anomalies increase. Even if you manage to arrive at a
reliable prompt for your task, that task is likely just one of a number of
interrelated tasks you need to do your job. It’ s natural to start exploring how
many other of these tasks could be done by AI and how you might string
them together .
One of the core principles of engineering is to use task decomposition to
break problems down into their component parts, so you can more easily
solve each individual problem and then reaggregate the results. Breaking
your AI work into multiple calls that are chained together can help you
accomplish more complex tasks, as well as provide more visibility into
what part of the chain is failing.There are lots of factors that go into product naming, and an important task
is naively outsourced to the AI with no visibility into how it’ s weighing the
importance of these factors (if at all). The way our current system works,
we’re getting a list of names, but all names are displayed with equal
importance with no further context for helping us decide. Fortunately AI
tools are capable of self-evaluation; if we add a second step to our task, we
can automatically check for nondesirable outputs.
