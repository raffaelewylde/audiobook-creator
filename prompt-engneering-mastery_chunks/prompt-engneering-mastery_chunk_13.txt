These principles are not short-lived tips or hacks  but are generally accepted
conventions that are useful for working with any level of intelligence,
biological or artificial. These principles are model-agnostic and should
work to improve your prompt no matter which generative text or image
model you’re using. We first published these principles in July 2022 in the
blog post “Prompt Engineering: From Words to Art and Copy” , and they
have stood the test of time, including mapping quite closely to OpenAI’ s
own Prompt Engineering Guide , which came a year later . Anyone whoworks closely with generative AI models is likely to conver ge on a similar
set of strategies for solving common issues, and throughout this book you’ll
see hundreds of demonstrative examples of how they can be useful for
improving your prompts.
We have provided downloadable one-pagers for text and image generation
you can use as a checklist when applying these principles. These were
created for our popular Udemy course The Complete Prompt Engineering
for AI Bootcamp  (70,000+ students), which was based on the same
principles but with dif ferent material to this book.

To show these principles apply equally well to prompting image models,
let’s use the following example, and explain how to apply each of the Five
Principles of Prompting to this specific scenario. Copy and paste the entire
input prompt into the Midjourney Bot in Discord, including the link to the
image at the beginning, after typing /imagine  to trigger the prompt box
to appear (requires a free Discord  account, and a paid Midjourney  account).
