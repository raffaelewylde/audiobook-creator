the OneFit UltraStride Shoes offer.The output of this prompt can now be plugged into image generation tools
like DALL-E or Midjourney as a prompt, which can give you a good
starting point for visualizing what the product might look like. Although
this might not be the final design you go with, seeing an image is more
evocative and helps people form an opinion faster . It’s easier cognitively to
criticize or compliment an existing image than it is to imagine a new image
from a blank page or section of text.

It’s common practice when working with AI professionally to chain
multiple calls to AI together , and even multiple models, to accomplish more
complex goals. Even single-prompt applications are often built
dynamically , based on outside context queried from various databases or
other calls to an AI model. The library LangChain  has developed tooling forchaining multiple prompt templates and queries together , making this
process more observable and well structured. A foundational example is
progressive summarization, where text that is too lar ge to fit into a context
window can be split into multiple chunks of text, with each being
summarized, before finally summarizing the summaries. If you talk to
builders of early AI products, you’ll find they’re all under the hood chaining
multiple prompts together , called AI chaining , to accomplish better results
in the final output.
The Reason and Act (ReAct)  framework was one of the first popular
attempts at AI agents, including the open source projects BabyAGI ,
AgentGPT  and Microsoft AutoGen . In ef fect, these agents are the result of
chaining multiple AI calls together in order to plan, observe, act, and then
evaluate the results of the action. Autonomous agents will be covered in
