Anthropic: Claude
Released on July 1 1, 2023, Claude 2  is setting itself apart from other
prominent LLMs such as ChatGPT  and LLaMA, with its pioneering
Constitutional AI approach to AI safety and alignment—training the model
using a list of rules or values. A notable enhancement in Claude 2 was itsexpanded context window of 100,000 tokens, as well as the ability to
upload files. In the realm of generative AI, a context window  refers to the
amount of text or data the model can actively consider or keep in mind
when generating a response. With a lar ger context window , the model can
understand and generate based on a broader context.
This advancement garnered significant enthusiasm from AI engineers, as it
opened up avenues for new and more intricate use cases. For instance,
Claude 2’ s augmented ability to process more information at once makes it
adept at summarizing extensive documents or sustaining in-depth
conversations. The advantage was short-lived, as OpenAI released their
128K version of GPT -4 only six months later . However , the fierce
competition between rivals is pushing the field forward.
The next generation of Claude included Opus , the first model to rival GPT -
4 in terms of intelligence, as well as Haiku, a smaller model that is
lightning-fast with the competitive price of $0.25 per million tokens (half
the cost of GPT -3.5-turbo at the time).
GPT-4V(ision)
In a significant leap forward, on September 23, 2023, OpenAI expanded the
capabilities of GPT -4 with the introduction of Vision, enabling users to
instruct GPT -4 to analyze images alongside text. This innovation was alsoreflected in the update to ChatGPT’ s interface, which now supports the
inclusion of both images and text as user inputs. This development signifies
a major trend toward multimodal models , which can seamlessly process and
understand multiple types of data, such as images and text, within a single
context.
