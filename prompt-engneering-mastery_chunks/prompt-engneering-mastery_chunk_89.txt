and sentiment. It enhances accuracy in the classification and provides a
heightened understanding of particular jar gon and expressions.
Limitations and Challenges in Sentiment Analysis
Despite the advancements in LLMs and the application of prompt
engineering techniques, sentiment analysis still faces some limitations and
challenges:
Handling sar casm and ir ony
Detecting sarcasm and irony in text can be dif ficult for LLMs, as it
often requires understanding the context and subtle cues that humans
can easily recognize. Misinterpreting sarcastic or ironic statements
may lead to inaccurate sentiment classification.
Identifying context-specific sentimentSentiment analysis can be challenging when dealing with context-
specific sentiments, such as those related to domain-specific jar gon
or cultural expressions. LLMs may struggle to accurately classify
sentiments in these cases without proper guidance or domain-specific
examples.
Least to Most
The least to most  technique in prompt engineering is a powerful method for
sequentially generating or extracting increasingly detailed knowledge on a
given topic. This method is particularly ef fective when dealing with
complex subjects or when a high level of detail is necessary .
Least to most uses a chain  of prompts where each new prompt is based on
the last answer . This step-by-step approach helps gather more detailed
information each time, making it easier to dive deeper into any topic.
This technique can also be applied to code generation, as demonstrated in a
Flask Hello World  app example.
Planning the Architecture
Before diving into the architecture, let’ s briefly understand what Flask is.
Flask  is a lightweight web application framework in Python, widely used
for creating web applications quickly and with minimal code. (Flask is onlyused for demonstration purposes here and isn’ t included within the
requir ements.txt  file for the book.
Now , let’s ask an LL
