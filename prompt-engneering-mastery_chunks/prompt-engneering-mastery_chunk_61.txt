 valid JSON.
There are several points that are worth adding to your prompts to improve
JSON parsing:
You must follow the following principles:
* Only return valid JSON* Never include backtick symbols such as: `
* The response will be parsed with json.loads(), ther
Now let’ s examine how you can parse a JSON output with Python :
import json
# openai_json_result = generate_article_outline(promp
openai_json_result  = """
{
    "Introduction": [
        "a. Overview of coding and programming langua
        "b. Importance of coding in today's technolog
    "Conclusion": [
        "a. Recap of the benefits of learning code",
        "b. The ongoing importance of coding skills i
}
"""
parsed_json_payload  = json.loads(openai_json_result )
print(parsed_json_payload )
'''{'Introduction': ['a. Overview of coding and progr
"b. Importance of coding in today's technology-driven
'Conclusion': ['a. Recap of the benefits of learning 
'b. The ongoing importance of coding skills in the moWell done, you’ve successfully parsed some JSON.
As showcased, structuring data from an LLM response is streamlined when
requesting  the response in valid JSON format. Compared to the previously
demonstrated regular expression parsing, this method is less cumbersome
and more straightforward.
So what could go wrong?
The language model accidentally adds extra text to the response such as
json output:  and your application logic only handles for valid
JSON.
The JSON produced isn’ t valid and fails upon parsing (either due to the
size or simply for not escaping certain characters).
Later on you will examine strategies to gracefully handle for such edge
cases.
YAML
.yml files are a structured data format that of fer dif ferent benefits over .json :
No need to escape characters
YAML ’s indentation pattern eliminates the need for braces, brackets,
and commas to denote structure. This can lead to cleaner and lesserror -prone files, as there’ s less risk of mismatched or misplaced
punctuation.
