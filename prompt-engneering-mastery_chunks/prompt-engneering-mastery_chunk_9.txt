Prompting
Prompt engineering  is the process of discovering prompts that reliably yield
useful or desired results.
A prompt  is the input you provide, typically text, when interfacing with an
AI model like ChatGPT  or Midjourney . The prompt serves as a set of
instructions the model uses to predict the desired response: text from large
language models  (LLMs) like ChatGPT , or images from diffusion models
like Midjourney .
