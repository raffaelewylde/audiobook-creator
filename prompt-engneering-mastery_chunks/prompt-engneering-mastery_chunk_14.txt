Figure 1-2. Stock photo of business meetingThis prompt takes advantage of Midjourney’ s ability to take a base image as
an example by uploading the image to Discord and then copy and pasting
the URL  into the prompt ( https://s.mj.run/TKAsyhNiKmc ), for which the
royalty-free image from Unsplash is used ( Figure 1-3 ). If you run into an
error with the prompt, try uploading the image yourself and reviewing
Midjourney’ s documentation  for any formatting changes.

Let’s compare this well-engineered prompt to what you get back from
Midjourney if you naively ask for a stock photo in the simplest way
possible. Figure 1-4  shows an example of what you get without promptengineering, an image with a darker , more stylistic take on a stock photo
than you’d typically expect.

Although less prominent an issue in v5 of Midjourney onwards, community
feedback mechanisms (when users select an image to resize to a higher
resolution, that choice may be used to train the model) have reportedly
biased the model toward a fantasy  aesthetic, which is less suitable for the
stock photo use case. The early adopters of Midjourney came from the
digital art world and naturally gravitated toward fantasy and sci-fi styles,
which can be reflected in the results from the model even when this
aesthetic is not suitable.Figure 1-4. People in a business meeting
Throughout this book the examples used will be compatiable with ChatGPT
Plus (GPT -4) as the text model and Midjourney v6 or Stable Dif fusion XL
as the image model, though we will specify if it’ s important. These
foundational models are the current state of the art and are good at a diverse
range of tasks. The principles are intended to be future-proof as much as ispossible, so if you’re reading this book when GPT -5, Midjourn
