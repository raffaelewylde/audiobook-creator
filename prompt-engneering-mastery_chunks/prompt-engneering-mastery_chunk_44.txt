In mathematical terms, the model calculates how likely each possible next
word is to follow the current sequence of words and picks the one that is
most likely:
wnext=argmaxP(w|w1,w2,...,wm)By repeating this process, as shown in Figure 2-3 , the model generates a
coherent and contextually relevant string of text as its output.

The mechanisms driving LLMs are rooted in vector mathematics, linear
transformations, and probabilistic models. While the under -the-hood
operations are computationally intensive, the core concepts are built on
these mathematical principles, of fering a foundational understanding that
bridges the gap between technical complexity and business applicability .Historical Underpinnings: The Rise of
Transformer Architectures
Language models like ChatGPT  (the GPT  stands for generative pr etrained
transformer ) didn’ t magically emer ge. They’re the culmination of years of
progress in the field of NLP , with particular acceleration since the late
2010s. At the heart of this advancement is the introduction of transformer
architectures, which were detailed in the groundbreaking paper “Attention
Is All You Need”  by the Google Brain team.
The real breakthrough of transformer architectures was the concept of
attention . Traditional models processed text sequentially , which limited
their understanding of language structure especially over long distances of
text. Attention transformed this by allowing models to directly relate distant
words to one another irrespective of their positions in the text. This was a
groundbreaking proposition. It meant that words and their context didn’ t
have to move through the entire model to af fect each other . This not only
significantly improved the models’  text comprehension but also made them
much more ef ficient.
This attention mechanism played a vital role in expanding the models’
capacity to detect long-range dependencies in text. This
