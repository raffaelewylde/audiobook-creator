Give GPTs “Thinking Time”
Often, by explicitly guiding an LLM to derive solutions fr om first principles
before reaching a verdict, you can garner more accurate responses.
Providing an LLM with thinking time  can often lead to better results.

Problem:
Jane has 5 apples, then John takes 2 from Mary. Mary 
apples. John then gives his apples to Jane.
How many apples does Jane have?
Proposed solution:
1. Janes originally had 5 apples.
2. John takes 2 apples from Mary, but this doesn't af3. John then gives his apples to Jane.
So, Jane's final count of apples is her original 5 ap
that John gave her, for a total of 7 apples.
Output:
Let's break down the problem:
1. Jane originally has 5 apples.
2. John takes 2 apples from Mary. However, this actio
impact the number of apples Jane has at this point.
3. John gives his apples to Jane.
Following these steps, we need to add the 2 apples Jo
Jane's original number of apples. Therefore:
5 apples (Jane's original number) + 2 apples (given b
So, Jane now has 7 apples. My solution matches the pr
In some cases, when using GPT -4 or other generative AI models, you may
not want the model’ s reasoning process to be visible to the user .
You can achieve this by asking an LLM to generate an inner monologue .
This is particularly useful in tutoring applications, where revealing themodel’ s reasoning might give away the solution prematurely .
The Inner Monologue Tactic
The inner monologue tactic  instructs the model to structure parts of the
output that should be hidden from the user in a specific format. This makes
it easy to remove these parts before presenting the final output to the user .
Here’ s how you can utilize this tactic to answer user queries ef fectively .

First, you need to work out your solution to
