ChatGPT  can also generate mock CSV  data that can be utilized for testing
purposes or other uses.
Input:
Generate a sample CSV data for five students with the
name, age, grade.
Output:
name,age,grade
John,16,A
Alex,17,B
Emma,16,A
Sophia,16,B
Liam,17,A
The example generated is a well-formatted CSV  file, which can be loaded
directly into many tools that read CSV  data.

Be clear about the desired format for optimal results.You’ve explored dif ferent ways of extracting structured data from language
models including regular expressions, JSON, YML, and other formats. You
can also now use LLMs to direct parts of your application’ s control flow .
