mere research output;
it was a compelling demonstration of the potential of transformer -based
architectures. This model showcased the initial steps toward makingmachines understand and generate human-like language, laying the
foundation for future advancements.
The unveiling of GPT -2 was met with both anticipation and caution.
Recognizing the model’ s powerful capabilities, OpenAI initially hesitated in
releasing it due to concerns about its potential misuse. Such was the might
of GPT -2 that ethical concerns took center stage, which might look quaint
compared to the power of today’ s models. However , when OpenAI decided
to release the project as open-source , it didn’ t just mean making the code
public. It allowed businesses and researchers to use these pretrained models
as building blocks, incorporating AI into their applications without starting
from scratch. This move democratized access to high-level natural language
processing capabilities, spurring innovation across various domains.
After GPT -2, OpenAI decided to focus on releasing paid, closed-source
models. GPT -3’s arrival marked a monumental stride in the progression of
LLMs. It garnered significant media attention, not just for its technical
prowess but also for the societal implications of its capabilities. This model
could produce text so convincing that it often became indistinguishable
from human-written content. From crafting intricate pieces of literature to
churning out operational code snippets, GPT -3 exemplified the seemingly
boundless potential of AI.GPT-3.5-turbo and ChatGPT
Bolstered by Microsoft’ s significant investment in their company , OpenAI
introduced GPT -3.5-turbo, an optimized version of its already exceptional
predecessor . Following a $1 billion injection  from Microsoft in 2019, which
later increased to a hefty $13 billion for a 49% stake in OpenAI’ s for-profit
arm, OpenAI used these resources to develop GPT -3.5-turbo, which of fered
