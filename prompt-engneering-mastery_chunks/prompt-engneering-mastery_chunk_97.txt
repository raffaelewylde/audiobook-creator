Problem Statement: A deck of cards has 52 cards: 13 h
clubs, and 13 spades. If two cards are drawn from the
replacement, what is the probability that one of the 
and the other one is a club?
User's Solution: (13/52)*(13/51) = 169/2652 = 13/204
Output:

Step 1 - My Solution:
First, calculate the probability of drawing 1 heart a

For the second draw, after removing 1 card (assuming

is 13/51.
Multiplying these two probabilities gives the probabi

Step 3 - Preparation of Hint:
Given that the user hasn't considered both sequences

sequences will be helpful. This could nudge the user 
direction without revealing the solution outright."""
