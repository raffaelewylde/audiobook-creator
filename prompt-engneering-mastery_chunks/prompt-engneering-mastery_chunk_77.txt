Poor Chunking Example
When text is not chunked correctly , it can lead to reduced LLM
performance. Consider the following paragraph from a news article:
The local council has decided to increase the budget 
this year, a move that has been welcomed by parents a
additional funds will be used to improve school infra
teachers, and provide better resources for students. 
argue that the increase is not enough to address the 
education system.
When the text is fragmented into isolated words, the resulting list lacks the
original context:["The", "local", "council", "has", "decided", "to", "
"budget", ...]
The main issues with this poor chunking example include:
Loss of context
By splitting the text into individual words, the original meaning and
relationships between the words are lost. This makes it dif ficult for
AI models to understand and respond ef fectively .
Increased pr ocessing load
Processing individual words requires more computational resources,
making it less ef ficient than processing lar ger chunks of text.
As a result of the poor chunking in this example, an LLM may face several
challenges:
Difficulty understanding the main ideas or themes of the text
Struggling to generate accurate summaries or translations
Inability to ef fectively perform tasks such as sentiment analysis or text
classification
By understanding the pitfalls of poor chunking, you can apply prompt
engineering principles to improve the process and achieve better resultswith AI language models.
Let’s explore an improved chunking example using the same news article
paragraph from the previous section; you’ll now chunk the text by sentence:
["""The local council has decided to increase the bud
by 10% this year, a move that has been welcomed by pa
""",
"""The additional funds will be used to improve schoo
hire more teachers, and provide better resources f
