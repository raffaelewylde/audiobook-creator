1. Give Direction
One of the issues with the naive text prompt discussed earlier was that it
wasn’ t briefing the AI on what types  of product names you wanted. To some
extent, naming a product is a subjective endeavor , and without giving the AI
an idea of what names you like, it has a low probability of guessing right.
By the way , a human would also struggle to complete this task without a
good brief , which is why creative and branding agencies require a detailed
briefing on any task from their clients.
TIP
Although it’ s not a perfect mapping, it can be helpful to imagine what context a human might need
for this task and try including it in the prompt.
In the example prompt we gave direction through the use of role-playing , in
that case emulating the style of Steve Jobs, who was famous for iconically
naming products. If you change this aspect of the prompt to someone else
who is famous in the training data (as well as matching the examples to the
right style), you’ll get dramatically dif ferent results.Input:
Brainstorm a list of product names for a shoe that fi
foot size, in the style of Elon Musk.
Return the results as a comma-separated list, in this
Product description: A shoe that fits any foot size
Product names: [list of 3 product names]
## Examples
Product description: A refrigerator that dispenses be
Product names: Teslacool, FridgeX, Neuradrink
Product description: A watch that can tell accurate t
space
Product names: WatchX, iSpace, The Watch Company
Product description: A home milkshake maker
Product names: ShakeX, The Milkshake Company, HyperSh
Output:
ShoeX, MarsFit, The Shoe Company
There are also some rules or best practices you would do well to follow ,
which could be included in the prompt as context to guide the AI toward aname that works. This technique is sometimes referred to as prewarming  or
