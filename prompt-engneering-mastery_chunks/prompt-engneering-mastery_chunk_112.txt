od that allows you to directly call the chat  object
with chat(messages=messages) :
response  = chat(messages =messages )Streaming Chat Models
You might have observed while using ChatGPT  how words are sequentially
returned to you, one character at a time. This distinct pattern of response
generation is referred to as streaming , and it plays a crucial role in
enhancing the performance of chat-based applications:
for chunk in chat.stream(messages ):
    print(chunk.content, end="", flush=True)
When you call chat.stream(messages) , it yields chunks of the
message one at a time. This means each segment of the chat message is
individually returned. As each chunk arrives, it is then instantaneously
printed to the terminal and flushed. This way , streaming  allows for minimal
latency from your LLM responses.
Streaming holds several benefits from an end-user perspective. First, it
dramatically reduces the waiting time for users. As soon as the text starts
generating character by character , users can start interpreting the message.
Thereâ€™ s no need for a full message to be constructed before it is seen. This,
in turn, significantly enhances user interactivity and minimizes latency .
Nevertheless, this technique comes with its own set of challenges. One
significant challenge is parsing the outputs while they are being streamed.Understanding and appropriately responding to the message as it is being
formed can prove to be intricate, especially when the content is complex
and detailed.
Creating Multiple LLM Generations
There may be scenarios where you find it useful to generate multiple
responses from LLMs. This is particularly true while creating dynamic
content like social media posts. Rather than providing a list of messages,
you provide a list of message lists .
Input:
# 2x lists of messages, which is the same as [message
synchronous_llm_result  = chat.batch([messages ]*2)
print(synchronous_llm_result )
Output:
[AIMessage (content='''Sure, here's a lighthearted jok
