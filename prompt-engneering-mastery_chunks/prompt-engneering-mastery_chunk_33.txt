 arranged
in a grid to show the ef fect that dif ferent elements of the prompt can have
on the final image.
Input:
{stock photo, oil painting, illustration} of business
meeting of {four, eight} people watching on white Mac
top of glass-top table
In Midjourney this would be compiled into six dif ferent prompts, one for
every combination of the three formats (stock photo, oil painting,
illustration) and two numbers of people (four , eight).
Input:1. stock photo of business meeting of four people wat
on white MacBook on top of glass-top table
2. stock photo of business meeting of eight people wa
on white MacBook on top of glass-top table
3. oil painting of business meeting of four people wa
on white MacBook on top of glass-top table
4. oil painting of business meeting of eight people w
on white MacBook on top of glass-top table
5. illustration of business meeting of four people wa
on white MacBook on top of glass-top table
6. illustration of business meeting of eight people w
on white MacBook on top of glass-top table
Each prompt generates its own four images as usual, which makes the
output a little harder to see. We have selected one from each prompt to
upscale and then put them together in a grid, shown as Figure 1-14 . You’ll
notice that the model doesn’ t always get the correct number of people
(generative AI models are surprisingly bad at math), but it has correctly
inferred the general intention by adding more people to the photos on the
right than the left.Figure 1-14  shows the output.
Figure 1-14. Prompt permutations gridWith models that have APIs like Stable Dif fusion, you can more easily
manipulate the photos and display them in a grid format for easy scanning.
You can also manipulate the random seed of the image to fix a style in place
for maximum reproducibility . With image classifiers it may also be possible
to programmatically rate images based on their safe content, or if they
contain certain elements associated with success or failure.
