on, and one of the quite
powerful ways you can give Midjourney direction is to supply the name of
an artist or art style to emulate. One artist that features heavily in the AI art
world is Van Gogh, known for his bold, dramatic brush strokes and vividuse of colors. Watch what happens when you include his name in the
prompt, as shown in Figure 1-6 .
Input:
people in a business meeting, by Van Gogh
Figure 1-6  shows the output.Figure 1-6. People in a business meeting, by Van Gogh
To get that last prompt to work, you need to strip back a lot of the other
direction. For example, losing the base image and the words stock photo  as
well as the camera Panasonic, DC-GH5  helps bring in Van Gogh’ s style.
The problem you may run into is that often with too much direction, the
model can quickly get to a conflicting combination that it can’ t resolve. Ifyour prompt is overly specific, there might not be enough samples in the
training data to generate an image that’ s consistent with all of your criteria.
In cases like these, you should choose which element is more important (in
this case, Van Gogh) and defer to that.
Direction is one of the most commonly used and broadest principles. It can
take the form of simply using the right descriptive words to clarify your
intent, or channeling the personas of relevant business celebrities. While too
much direction can narrow the creativity of the model, too little direction is
the more common problem.
2. Specify Format
AI models are universal translators. Not only does that mean translating
from French to English, or Urdu to Klingon, but also between data
structures like JSON to YAML, or natural language to Python code. These
models are capable of returning a response in almost any format, so an
important part of prompt engineering is finding ways to specify what format
you want the response to be in.
Every now and again you’ll find that the same prompt will return a dif ferent
format, for example, a numbered list instead of comma sepa
