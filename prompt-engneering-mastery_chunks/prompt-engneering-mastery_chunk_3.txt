[LSI]Preface
The rapid pace of innovation in generative AI promises to change how we
live and work, but it’ s getting increasingly dif ficult to keep up. The number
of AI papers published on arXiv is growing exponentially , Stable Dif fusion
has been among the fastest growing open source projects in history , and AI
art tool Midjourney’ s Discord server  has tens of millions of members,
surpassing even the lar gest gaming communities. What most captured the
public’ s imagination was OpenAI’ s release of ChatGPT , which reached 100
million users in two months , making it the fastest-growing consumer app in
history . Learning to work with AI has quickly become one of the most in-
demand skills.
Everyone using AI professionally quickly learns that the quality of the
output depends heavily on what you provide as input. The discipline of
prompt engineering  has arisen as a set of best practices for improving the
reliability , efficiency , and accuracy of AI models. “In ten years, half of the
world’ s jobs w
