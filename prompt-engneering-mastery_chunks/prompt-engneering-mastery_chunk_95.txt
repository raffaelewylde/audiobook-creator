GIVE DIRECTION AND SPECIFY FORMAT
The preceding prompt is excellent as it both instructs the model on how to find answers and also sets
a specific response format for any unanswerable questions.
Considering the constrained context windows of GPT s, a method for
dynamically retrieving information relevant to the asked query might be
necessary to utilize this strategy .
Another approach is to direct the model to incorporate r eferences  from a
given text in its response. When the input is enhanced with relevant
information, the model can be guided to include citations in its responses by
referring to sections of the supplied documents. This approach has the
added benefit that citations in the output can be authenticated automatically
by matching strings  within the given documents.Input:
