ill be in prompt engineering,” claims Robin Li , the cofounder
and CEO of Chinese tech giant Baidu. However , we expect prompting to be
a skill required of many jobs, akin to proficiency in Microsoft Excel, rather
than a popular job title in itself. This new wave of disruption is changing
everything we thought we knew about computers. We’re used to writing
algorithms that return the same result every time—not so for AI, where the
responses are non-deterministic. Cost and latency are real factors again,after decades of Moore’ s law making us complacent in expecting real-time
computation at negligible cost. The biggest hurdle is the tendency of these
models to confidently make things up, dubbed hallucination , causing us to
rethink the way we evaluate the accuracy of our work.
We’ve been working with generative AI since the GPT -3 beta in 2020, and
as we saw the models progress, many early prompting tricks and hacks
became no longer necessary . Over time a consistent set of principles
emer ged that were still useful with the newer models, and worked across
both text and image generation. We have written this book based on these
timeless principles, helping you learn transferable skills that will continue
to be useful no matter what happens with AI over the next five years. The
key to working with AI isn’ t “figuring out how to hack the prompt by
adding one magic word to the end that changes everything else,” as OpenAI
cofounder Sam Altman asserts , but what will always matter is the “quality
of ideas and the understanding of what you want.” While we don’ t know if
we’ll call it “prompt engineering” in five years, working ef fectively with
generative AI will only become more important.
