Self-Eval LLM  Responses
Another tactic you can use is to critque a generated LLM output  and ask
whether the LLM missed any information or important facts. You’re
essentially asking an LLM to evaluate itself  based on its previous output.
First, create a prompt to generate a "Hello World"  function.
Input:
Generate a "Hello World" Python function.
Output:
Sure, here's a very simple Python function that print
the console:
def print_hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")print_hello_world()
When you run this function, it will print the string 
console.
The LLM returns a simple Python function called
print_hello_world()  that prints the traditional “Hello, World!”
greeting.
Then make a second LLM request with the previous chat history , asking for
the initial output to be improved.
Input:
...Previous Chat History...
Given the previous function, can you improve it again
Perhaps defaults or type hints?
Output:
We can add type hints to make it clear that the funct
arguments and doesn't return anything. We can also ad
describe what the function does.Here's the improved code:
def print_hello_world() -> None:
    """
    Prints "Hello, World!" to the standard output.
    """
    print("Hello, World!")
If you wanted to make the function more flexible, you
argument that allows you to print a different message
def print_message(message: str = "Hello, World!") -> 
    """
    Prints the given message to the standard output. 
    , it defaults to "Hello, World!".
    Args:
        message (str, optional): The message to be pr
        Defaults to "Hello, World!".
    """
    print(message)
Consequently GPT -4 returns an upgraded version of the function, now
furnished with Python type hints and a default ar gument. This enriches the
function with greater flexibility , allowing it to print not just "Hello,
World!"  but any user -specified message.These prompt-response exchanges illustrate how
