ut the importance of asking for context  when
working with LLMs such as GPT -4. We will start with an example of a
prompt that doesn’ t provide enough context, resulting in a less useful
response.
Then, we will provide a better prompt that encourages the model to ask for
additional context if needed. Finally , we will use the additional context
provided to generate a more informed response.
Input:
Should I use MongoDB or PostgreSQL for my project?
Output:
It's difficult to make a recommendation without knowi
specific software requirements. Both MongoDB and Post

In the preceding prompt, the model does not have enough context to make a
meaningful recommendation. Instead, you can ask ChatGPT  for a list ofrecommended points that would help it to make an ef fective decision.
