Limitations with Few-Shot Examples
Few-shot learning has limitations. Although it can prove beneficial in
certain scenarios, it might not always yield the expected high-qualityresults. This is primarily due to two reasons:
Pretrained models like GPT -4 can sometimes overfit to the few-shot
examples, making them prioritize the examples over the actual prompt.
LLMs have a token limit. As a result, there will always be a trade-of f
between the number of examples and the length of the response.
Providing more examples might limit the response length and vice versa.
These limitations can be addressed in several ways. First, if few-shot
prompting is not yielding the desired results, consider using dif ferently
framed phrases or experimenting with the language of the prompts
themselves. Variations in how the prompt is phrased can result in dif ferent
responses, highlighting the trial-and-error nature of prompt engineering.
Second, think about including explicit instructions to the model to ignore
the examples after it understands the task or to use the examples just for
formatting guidance. This might influence the model to not overfit to the
examples.
If the tasks are complex and the performance of the model with few-shot
learning is not satisfactory , you might need to consider fine-tuning  your
model. Fine-tuning provides a more nuanced understanding of a specific
task to the model, thus improving the performance significantly .Saving and Loading LLM Prompts
To effectively leverage generative AI models such as GPT -4, it is beneficial
to store prompts as files instead of Python code. This approach enhances the
shareability , storage, and versioning of your prompts.
LangChain supports both saving and loading prompts from JSON and
YAML. Another key feature of LangChain is its support for detailed
specification in one file or distributed across multiple files. This
