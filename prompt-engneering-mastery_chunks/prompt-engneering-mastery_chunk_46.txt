t are essential for training LLMs.
The demand for powerful, ef ficient GPUs has skyrocketed as companies
strive to build ever -larger and more complex models. It’ s not just the raw
computational power that’ s sought after . GPUs also need to be fine-tuned
for tasks endemic to machine learning, like tensor operations. Tensors , in a
machine learning context, are multidimensional arrays of data, and
operations on them are foundational to neural network computations. This
emphasis on specialized capabilities has given rise to tailored hardware
such as NVIDIA ’s H100 Tensor Core GPUs, explicitly crafted to expedite
machine learning workloads.
Furthermore, the overwhelming demand often outstrips the supply of these
top-tier GPUs, sending prices on an upward trajectory . This supply-demand
interplay has transformed the GPU market into a fiercely competitive and
profitable arena. Here, an eclectic clientele, ranging from tech behemoths to
academic researchers, scramble to procure the most advanced hardware.This sur ge in demand has sparked a wave of innovation beyond just GPUs.
Companies are now focusing on creating dedicated AI hardware, such as
Google’ s Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), to cater to the growing
computational needs of AI models.
This evolving landscape underscores not just the symbiotic ties between
software and hardware in the AI sphere but also spotlights the ripple ef fect
of the LLM gold rush . It’s steering innovations and funneling investments
into various sectors, especially those offering the fundamental components
for crafting these models.
OpenAI’s Generative Pretrained
Transformers
Founded with a mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits
all of humanity , OpenAI  has recently been at the forefront of the AI
revolution. One of their most groundbreaking contributions has been the
GPT series of models, which have substantially redefined the boundaries of
what LLMs can achieve.
The original GPT  model by OpenAI was more than a
