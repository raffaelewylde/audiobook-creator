e results considerably . However , the cost of running many
tests at scale can add up, and the latency or rate limits of GPT -4 can be a
blocker . If at all possible, a prompt engineer should first test using
programmatic techniques that don’ t require a call to an LLM, such as
simply measuring the length of the response, which runs near instantly for
close to zero cost.Meta Prompting
Meta pr ompting  is a technique that involves the creation of text prompts
that, in turn, generate other text prompts. These text prompts are then used
to generate new assets in many mediums such as images, videos, and more
text.
To better understand meta prompting, let’ s take the example of authoring a
children’ s book with the assistance of GPT -4. First, you direct the LLM to
generate the text for your children’ s book. Afterward, you invoke meta
prompting by instructing GPT -4 to produce prompts that are suitable for
image-generation models. This could mean creating situational descriptions
or specific scenes based on the storyline of your book, which then can be
given to AI models like Midjourney or Stable Dif fusion. These image-
generation models can, therefore, deliver images in harmony with your AI-
crafted children’ s story .

of crafting a children’ s book.Figure 3-8. Utilizing an LLM to generate image prompts for MidJourney’ s image creation in the

Meta prompts of fer a multitude of benefits for a variety of applications:
Image generation fr om pr oduct descriptions
Meta prompts can be employed to derive an image generation
prompt for image models like Midjourney , effectively creating a
visual representation of product descriptions.
Generating style/featur e prompts
Let’s consider you are a copywriter needing to develop a unique style
guide prompt from a couple of blog posts. Given each client has adistinctive tone and style, it’ s beneficial to utilize a meta
