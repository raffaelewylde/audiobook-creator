 data, resulting in the
emer gent capability of producing text that closely resembles human
language output. These models have generalized across diverse
applications, from writing content to automating software development and
enabling real-time interactive chatbot experiences.
What Are Text Generation Models?
Text generation models utilize advanced algorithms to understand the
meaning in text and produce outputs that are often indistinguishable from
human work. If you’ve ever interacted with ChatGPT  or marveled at its
ability to craft coherent and contextually relevant sentences, you’ve
witnessed the power of an LLM in action.
In natural language processing (NLP) and LLMs, the fundamental linguistic
unit is a token . Tokens  can represent sentences, words, or even subwords
such as a set of characters. A useful way to understand the size of text data
is by looking at the number of tokens it comprises; for instance, a text of100 tokens roughly equates to about 75 words. This comparison can be
essential for managing the processing limits of LLMs as dif ferent models
may have varying token capacities.
Tokenization , the process of breaking down text into tokens, is a crucial step
in preparing data for NLP  tasks. Several methods can be used for
tokenization, including Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) , WordPiece, and
SentencePiece. Each of these methods has its unique advantages and is
suited to particular use cases. BPE is commonly used due to its ef ficiency in
handling a wide range of vocabulary while keeping the number of tokens
manageable.
BPE begins by viewing a text as a series of individual characters. Over
time, it combines characters that frequently appear together into single
units, or tokens. To understand this better , consider the word apple . Initially ,
BPE might see it as a, p, p, l, and e. But after noticing that p often comes
after a and before l in the dataset, it might combine them and treat appl as a
single token in future instances.
