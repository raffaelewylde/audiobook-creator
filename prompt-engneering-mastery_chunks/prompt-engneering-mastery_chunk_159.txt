There are newer , more customizable approaches to creating summarization
chains using LCEL, but for most of your needs
load_summarize_chain  provides suf ficient results.
Summary
In this chapter , you comprehensively reviewed the LangChain framework
and its essential components. You learned about the importance of
document loaders for gathering data and the role of text splitters in handling
large text blocks.Moreover , you were introduced to the concepts of task decomposition and
prompt chaining. By breaking down complex problems into smaller tasks,
you saw the power of problem isolation. Furthermore, you now grasp how
prompt chaining can combine multiple inputs/outputs for richer idea
generation.
In the next chapter , you’ll learn about vector databases, including how to
integrate these with documents from LangChain, and this ability will serve
a pivotal role in enhancing the accuracy of knowledge extraction from your
data.Chapter 5. Vector Databases with FAISS
and Pinecone
This chapter introduces the concept of embeddings and vector databases,
discussing how they can be used to provide relevant context in prompts.
A vector database  is a tool most commonly used for storing text data in a
way that enables querying based on similarity or semantic meaning. This
technology is used to decrease hallucinations (where the AI model makes
something up) by referencing data the model isn’ t trained on, significantly
improving the accuracy and quality of the LLM’ s response. Use cases for
vector databases also include reading documents, recommending similar
products, or remembering past conversations.
Vectors  are lists of numbers representing text (or images), which you might
think of as coordinates for a location. The vector for the word mouse  using
OpenAI’ s text-embedding-ada-002 model is a list of 1,536 numbers, each
representing the value for a feature the embedding model learned in
training:
[-0.011904156766831875,
 -0.0323905423283577, 0.001950666424818337,
