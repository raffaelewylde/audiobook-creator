you can easily refine
generated LLM outputs until you’re satisfied with the final output.
NOTE
It’s possible to critique an LLM’ s response multiple times, until no further refinement is provided by
the LLM.
Classification with LLMs
Classifying, in the context of AI, refers to the process of predicting the class
or category of a given data point or sample. It’ s a common task in machine
learning where models are trained to assign predefined labels to unlabeled
data based on learned patterns.
LLMs are powerful assets when it comes to classification, even with zero or
only a small number of examples provided within a prompt. Why? That’ s
because LLMs, like GPT -4, have been previously trained on an extensive
dataset and now possess a degree of reasoning.
There are two overarching strategies in solving classification problems with
LLMs: zero-shot learning  and few-shot learning .
Zero-shot learningIn this process, the LLM classifies data with exceptional accuracy ,
without the aid of any prior specific examples. It’ s akin to acing a
project without any preparation—impressive, right?
Few-shot learning
Here, you provide your LLM with a small number of examples. This
strategy can significantly influence the structure of your output
format and enhance the overall classification accuracy .
Why is this groundbreaking for you?
Leveraging LLMs lets you sidestep lengthy processes that traditional
machine learning processes demand. Therefore, you can quickly prototype a
classification model, determine a base level accuracy , and create immediate
business value.
WARNING
Although an LLM can perform classification, depending upon your problem and training data you
might find that using a traditional machine learning process could yield better results.
Building a Classification Model
Let’s explore a few-shot learning example to determine the sentiment of
text into either 'Compliment' , 'Complaint' , or 'Neutral' .Given the statement, classify it as either "Complimen
"Neutral":
