y by an LLM, providing a comprehensive
solution when combined.
Content generation
For generating long-form content such as articles or blogs, the task
can be decomposed into generating an outline, writing individual
sections, and then compiling and refining the final draft. Each step
can be individually managed by GPT -4 for better results.
Large document summary
Summarizing lengthy documents such as research papers or reports
can be done more ef fectively by decomposing the task into several
smaller tasks, like understanding individual sections, summarizing
them independently , and then compiling a final summary .
Interactive conversational agents
For creating advanced chatbots, task decomposition can help manage
different aspects of conversation such as understanding user input,maintaining context, generating relevant responses, and managing
dialogue flow .
Learning and tutoring systems
In digital tutoring systems, decomposing the task of teaching a
concept into understanding the learner ’s current knowledge,
identifying gaps, suggesting learning materials, and evaluating
progress can make the system more ef fective. Each subtask can
leverage GPT -4’s generative abilities.Figure 4-3. Task decomposition with LLMsDIVIDE LABOR
Task decomposition is a crucial strategy for you to tap into the full potential of LLMs. By dissecting
complex problems into simpler , manageable tasks, you can leverage the problem-solving abilities of
these models more ef fectively and ef ficiently .
In the sections ahead, you’ll learn how to create and integrate multiple LLM
chains to orchestrate more complicated workflows.
Prompt Chaining
Often you’ll find that attempting to do a single task within one prompt is
impossible. You can utilize a mixture of prompt chaining , which involves
combining multiple prompt inputs/outputs with specifically tailored LLM
prompts to build up an idea.
Let’s imagine an example with a film company that would like to partially
automate their film creation. This
