rection, formatting
the output, incorporating examples, establishing an evaluation system, and
dividing complex tasks into smaller prompts are key principles of promptengineering. By applying these principles and using common prompting
techniques, you can improve the quality and reliability of AI-generated
outputs.
You also explored the role of prompt engineering in generating product
names and images. You saw how specifying the desired format and
providing instructive examples can greatly influence the AIâ€™s output.
Additionally , you learned about the concept of role-playing, where you can
ask the AI to generate outputs as if it were a famous person like Steve Jobs.
The chapter emphasized the need for clear direction and context to achieve
desired outcomes when using generative AI models. Furthermore, you
discovered the importance of evaluating the performance of AI models and
the various methods used for measuring results, as well as the trade-of fs
between quality and token usage, cost, and latency .
In the next chapter , you will be introduced to text generation models. You
will learn about the dif ferent types of foundation models and their
capabilities, as well as their limitations. The chapter will also review the
standard OpenAI of ferings, as well as competitors and open source
alternatives. By the end of the chapter , you will have a solid understanding
of the history of text generation models and their relative strengths and
weaknesses. This book will return to image generation prompting in
Chapters 7, 8, and 9, so you should feel free to skip ahead if that is your
immediate need. Get ready to dive deeper into the discipline of prompt
engineering and expand your comfort working with AI.Chapter 2. Introduction to Large
Language Models for Text Generation
In artificial intelligence, a recent focus has been the evolution of lar ge
language models. Unlike their less-flexible predecessors, LLMs are capable
of handling and learning from a much lar ger volume of
