This is already a remarkable response for a naive prompt, which feels like
magic because we got here with very little ef fort. As the state-of-the-art
models improve, the likelihood you will get good enough  results on your
first try goes up. For any throwaway interactions with an AI, where you
don’t plan to do the same task again, the naive approach is all you need.
However , if you planned to put this prompt into production, you’d benefit
from investing more work into getting it right. Mistakes cost you money in
terms of the fees OpenAI char ges based on the length of the prompt and
response, as well as the time spent fixing mistakes. If you were building a
product name generator with thousands of users, there are some obvious
issues you’d want attempt to fix:
Vague dir ectionYou’re not briefing the AI on what style of name you want, or what
attributes it should have. Do you want a single word or a
concatenation? Can the words be made up, or is it important that
they’re in real English? Do you want the AI to emulate somebody
you admire who is famous for great product names?
Unformatted output
You’re getting back a list of separated names line by line, of
unspecified length. When you run this prompt multiple times, you’ll
see sometimes it comes back with a numbered list, and often it has
text at the beginning, which makes it hard to parse programmatically .
Missing examples
You haven’ t given the AI any examples of what good  names look
like. It’ s autocompleting using an average of its training data, i.e., the
entire internet (with all its inherent bias), but is that what you want?
Ideally you’d feed it examples of successful names, common names
in an industry , or even just other names you like.
Limited evaluation
You have no consistent or scalable
