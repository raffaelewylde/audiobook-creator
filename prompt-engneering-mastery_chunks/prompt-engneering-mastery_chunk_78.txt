DIVIDE LABOR AND EVALUATE QUALITY
Define the granularity at which the text should be chunked, such as by sentence, paragraph, or topic.
Adjust parameters like the number of tokens or model temperature to optimize the chunking process.
By chunking the text in this manner , you could insert whole sentences into
an LLM prompt with the most relevant sentences.Chunking Strategies
There are many dif ferent chunking strategies, including:
Splitting by sentence
Preserves the context and structure of the original content, making it
easier for LLMs to understand and process the information.
Sentence-based chunking is particularly useful for tasks like
summarization, translation, and sentiment analysis.
Splitting by paragraph
This approach is especially ef fective when dealing with longer
content, as it allows the LLM to focus on one cohesive unit at a time.
Paragraph-based chunking is ideal for applications like document
analysis, topic modeling, and information extraction.
Splitting by topic or section
This method can help AI models better identify and understand the
main themes and ideas within the content. Topic-based chunking is
well suited for tasks like text classification, content
recommendations, and clustering.
Splitting by complexityFor certain applications, it might be helpful to split text based on its
complexity , such as the reading level or technicality of the content.
By grouping similar complexity levels together , LLMs can more
effectively process and analyze the text. This approach is useful for
tasks like readability analysis, content adaptation, and personalized
learning.
Splitting by length
This technique is particularly helpful when working with very long
or complex documents, as it allows LLMs to process the content
more ef ficiently . Length-based chunking is suitable for applications
like lar ge-scale text analysis, search engine indexing,
