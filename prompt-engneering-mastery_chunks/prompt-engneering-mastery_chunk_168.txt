up to August 2020 and therefore is unaware of any new words or
new cultural associations that formed after that cutof f date. This can cause a
problem for use cases that need more recent context or niche domain
knowledge not available in the training data, which may necessitate training
a custom model.
In some instances it might make sense to train your own embedding model.
For instance, you might do this if the text used has a domain-specific
vocabulary where specific words have a meaning separate from the
generally accepted meaning of the word. One example might be tracing thelanguage used by toxic groups on social media like Q-Anon, who evolve
the language they use in posts to bypass moderation actions.
Training your own embeddings can be done with tools like word2vec, a
method to represent words in a vector space, enabling you to capture the
semantic meanings of words. More advanced models may be used, like
GloV e (Global Vectors for Word Representation), which is used by spaCy
for its embeddings, which are trained on the Common Crawl dataset, an
open source snapshot of the web. The library Gensim of fers a simple
process for training your own custom embeddings using the open source
algorithm  word2vec.
