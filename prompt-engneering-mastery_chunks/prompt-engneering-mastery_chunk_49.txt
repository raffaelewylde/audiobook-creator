 ChatGPT  is now a go-to for
customer service, virtual assistance, and numerous other applications that
require the finesse of human-like conversation.
GPT-4
In 2024, OpenAI released GPT -4, which excels in understanding complex
queries and generating contextually relevant and coherent text. For
example, GPT -4 scored in the 90th percentile of the bar exam with a score
of 298 out of 400. Currently , GPT -3.5-turbo is free to use in ChatGPT , but
GPT-4 requires a monthly payment .
GPT-4 uses a mixture-of-experts approach ; it goes beyond relying on a
single model’ s inference to produce even more accurate and insightful
results.
On May 13, 2024, OpenAI introduced GPT-4o, an advanced model capable
of processing and reasoning across text, audio, and vision inputs in real
time. This model of fers enhanced performance, particularly in vision and
audio understanding; it is also faster and more cost-ef fective than its
predecessors due to its ability to process all three modalities in one neural
network.Google’s Gemini
After Google lost search market share due to ChatGPT  usage, it initially
released Bard on March 21, 2023. Bard was a bit rough around the edges
and definitely didn’ t initially have the same high-quality LLM responses
that ChatGPT  offered ( Figure 2-5 ).
Google has kept adding extra features over time including code generation,
visual AI, real-time search, and voice into Bard, bringing it closer to
ChatGPT  in terms of quality .
On March 14, 2023, Google released PaLM API, allowing developers to
access it on Google Cloud Platform. In April 2023, Amazon Web Services
(AWS) released similar services such as Amazon Bedrock  and Amazon’ s
Titan FMs . Google rebranded Bard to Gemini  for their v1.5 release in
February 2024 and started to get results similar to GPT -4.Figure 2-5. Bard hallucinating results about the James Webb Space Telescope
Also, Google released two smaller open source models  based on the same
architecture as Gemini. OpenAI is finally no longe
