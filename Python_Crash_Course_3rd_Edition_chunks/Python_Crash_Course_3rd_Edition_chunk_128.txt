 21) and 18 to
see if age  is greater than or equal to 18. This test evaluates to True .
How do you use the int()  function in an actual program? Consider a
program that determines whether people are tall enough to ride a roller
coaster:
roller coaster .py
height = input("How tall are you, in inches? ")
height = int(height)
if height >= 48:
    print("\nYou're tall enough to ride!")
else:
    print("\nYou'll be able to ride when you're a litThe program can compare height  to 48 because height =
int(height)  converts the input value to a numerical representation
before the comparison is made. If the number entered is greater than or
equal to 48, we tell the user that they’re tall enough:
How tall are you, in inches? 71
You're tall enough to ride!
When you use numerical input to do calculations and comparisons, be sure
to convert the input value to a numerical representation first.
The Modulo Operator
A useful tool for working with numerical information is the modulo
operator (%), which divides one number by another number and returns
the remainder:
>>> 4 % 3
1
>>> 5 % 3
2
>>> 6 % 3
0>>> 7 % 3
1
The modulo operator doesn’ t tell you how many times one number fits into
another; it only tells you what the remainder is.
When one number is divisible by another number , the remainder is 0, so the
modulo operator always returns 0. You can use this fact to determine if a
number is even or odd:
even_or_odd.py
number = input("Enter a number, and I'll tell you if 
number = int(number)
if number % 2 == 0:
    print(f"\nThe number {number} is even.")
else:
    print(f"\nThe number {number} is odd.")
Even numbers are always divisible by two, so if the modulo of a number
and two is zero (here, if number % 2 == 0 ) the number is even.
Otherwise, it’ s odd.Enter a number, and I'll tell you if it's even or odd
The number 42 is even.
