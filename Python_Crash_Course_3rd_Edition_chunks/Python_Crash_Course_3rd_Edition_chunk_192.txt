Another useful function is choice() . This function takes in a list or tuple
and returns a randomly chosen element:
>>> from random import choice
>>> players = ['charles', 'martina', 'michael', 'flor
>>> first_up = choice(players)
>>> first_up
'florence'
The random  module shouldn’ t be used when building security-related
applications, but it works well for many fun and interesting projects.NOTE
You can also download modules fr om external sour ces. Y ou’ll see a
number of these examples in Part II, wher e we’ll need external
modules to complete each pr oject.TRY IT YOURSELF
9-13. Dice:  Make a class Die  with one attribute called sides , which has a default value of 6.
Write a method called roll_die()  that prints a random number between 1 and the number of
sides the die has. Make a 6-sided die and roll it 10 times.
Make a 10-sided die and a 20-sided die. Roll each die 10 times.
9-14. Lottery:  Make a list or tuple containing a series of 10 numbers and 5 letters. Randomly
select 4 numbers or letters from the list and print a message saying that any ticket matching
these 4 numbers or letters wins a prize.
9-15. Lottery Analysis:  You can use a loop to see how hard it might be to win the kind of
lottery you just modeled. Make a list or tuple called my_ticket . Write a loop that keeps
pulling numbers until your ticket wins. Print a message reporting how many times the loop had
to run to give you a winning ticket.
9-16. Python Module of the Week: One excellent resource for exploring the Python standard
library is a site called Python Module of the W eek. Go to https://pymotw .com  and look at the
table of contents. Find a module that looks interesting to you and read about it, perhaps starting
with the random  module.
Styling Classes
A few styling issues related to classes are worth clarifying, especially as
your programs become more complicated.Class names should be written in CamelCase . To do this, capitalize the firs
