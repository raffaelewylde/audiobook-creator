es a number of important attributes used throughout the
game: the settings are assigned to settings , the main display surface is
assigned to screen , and a ship  instance is created in this file as well.
The main loop of the game, a while  loop, is also stored in this module.
The while  loop calls _check_events() , ship.update() , and
_update_screen() . It also ticks the clock on each pass through the
loop.
The _check_events()  method detects relevant events, such as
keypresses and releases, and processes each of these types of events
through the methods _check_keydown_events()  and
_check_keyup_events() . For now , these methods manage the ship’ s
movement. The AlienInvasion  class also contains_update_screen() , which redraws the screen on each pass through the
main loop.
The alien_invasion.py file is the only file you need to run when you want to
play Alien Invasion . The other files, settings.py  and ship.py , contain code
that is imported into this file.
settings.py
The settings.py  file contains the Settings  class. This class only has an
__init__()  method, which initializes attributes controlling the game’ s
appearance and the ship’ s speed.
ship.py
The ship.py  file contains the Ship  class. The Ship  class has an
__init__()  method, an update()  method to manage the ship’ s
position, and a blitme()  method to draw the ship to the screen. The
image of the ship is stored in ship.bmp , which is in the images  folder .TRY IT YOURSELF
12-3. Pygame Documentation:  We’re far enough into the game now that you might want to
look at some of the Pygame documentation. The Pygame home page is at https://pygame.or g,
and the home page for the documentation is at https://pygame.or g/docs . Just skim the
documentation for now . You won’ t need it to complete this project, but it will help if you want
to modify Alien Invasion  or make your own game afterward.
12-4. Rocket:  Make a game that begins with a rocket in the center of the screen. Allow the
player to move the roc
