t position 0 and stores the value
'ducati'  at that location:
['ducati', 'honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
This operation shifts every other value in the list one position to the right.Removing Elements fr om a List
Often, you’ll want to remove an item or a set of items from a list. For
example, when a player shoots down an alien from the sky , you’ll most
likely want to remove it from the list of active aliens. Or when a user
decides to cancel their account on a web application you created, you’ll
want to remove that user from the list of active users. You can remove an
item according to its position in the list or according to its value.
Removing an Item Using the del Statement
If you know the position of the item you want to remove from a list, you
can use the del  statement:
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
del motorcycles[0]
print(motorcycles)
Here we use the del  statement to remove the first item, 'honda' , from
the list of motorcycles:
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['yamaha', 'suzuki']You can remove an item from any position in a list using the del
statement if you know its index. For example, here’ s how to remove the
second item, 'yamaha' , from the list:
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles)
del motorcycles[1]
print(motorcycles)
The second motorcycle is deleted from the list:
['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
['honda', 'suzuki']
In both examples, you can no longer access the value that was removed
from the list after the del  statement is used.
Removing an Item Using the pop() Method
Sometimes you’ll want to use the value of an item after you remove it from
a list. For example, you might want to get the x and y position of an alien
that was just shot down, so you can draw an explosion at that position. In a
web application, you might want to remove a user from a list of active
members and then add that user to a list of inactive members.The pop()  method removes the last item in a list, but it lets you work
