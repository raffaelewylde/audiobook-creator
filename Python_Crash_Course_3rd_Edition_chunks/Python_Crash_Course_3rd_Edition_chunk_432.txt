There’ s still a bit more we need to add to base.html . We need to define two
blocks that the individual pages can use to place the content specific to
those pages.Defining the Main Part of the Page
The rest of base.html  contains the main part of the page:
base.html
  --snip--
  </nav> <!-- End of navbar -->
❶   <main class="container">
❷     <div class="pb-2 mb-2 border-bottom">
      {% block page_header %}{% endblock page_header 
    </div>
❸     <div>
      {% block content %}{% endblock content %}
    </div>
  </main>
</body>
</html>
We first open a <main>  tag ❶. The main  element is used for the most
significant part of the body of a page. Here we assign the bootstrap selector
container , which is a simple way to group elements on a page. We’ll
place two div elements in this container .The first div element contains a page_header  block ❷. We’ll use this
block to title most pages. To make this section stand out from the rest of the
page, we place some padding below the header . Padding  refers to space
between an element’ s content and its border . The selector pb-2  is a
bootstrap directive that provides a moderate amount of padding at the
bottom of the styled element. A margin is the space between an element’ s
border and other elements on the page. The selector mb-2  provides a
moderate amount of mar gin at the bottom of this div . We want a border on
the bottom of this block, so we use the selector border-bottom , which
provides a thin border at the bottom of the page_header  block.
We then define one more div element that contains the block content  ❸.
We don’ t apply any specific style to this block, so we can style the content
of any page as we see fit for that page. The end of the base.html  file has
closing tags for the main , body , and html  elements.
