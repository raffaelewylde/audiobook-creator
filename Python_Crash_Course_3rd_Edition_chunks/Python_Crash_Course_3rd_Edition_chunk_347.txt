We pass the list
lats  to the lat  argument, and lons  to the lon  argument.When you run this file, you should see a map that looks like the one in Figu
re 16-7 . This again shows the power of the Plotly Express library; in just
three lines of code, we have a map of global earthquake activity .

Now that we know the information in our dataset is being plotted correctly ,
we can make a few changes to make the map more meaningful and easier to
read.
Repr esenting Magnitudes
A map of earthquake activity should show the magnitude of each
earthquake. We can also include more data, now that we know the data isbeing plotted correctly .
--snip--
# Read data as a string and convert to a Python objec
path = Path('eq_data/eq_data_30_day_m1.geojson')
contents = path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
--snip--
title = 'Global Earthquakes'
fig = px.scatter_geo(lat=lats, lon=lons, size=mags, t
fig.show()
We load the file eq_data_30_day_m1.geojson , to include a full 30 days’
worth of earthquake activity . We also use the size ar gument in the
px.scatter_geo()  call, which specifies how the points on the map will
be sized. We pass the list mags  to size , so earthquakes with a higher
magnitude will show up as lar ger points on the map.
The resulting map is shown in Figure 16-8 . Earthquakes usually occur near
tectonic plate boundaries, and the longer period of earthquake activity
included in this map reveals the exact locations of these boundaries.Figure 16-8 : The map now shows the magnitude of all earthquakes in the last 30 days.
This map is better , but it’ s still dif ficult to pick out which points represent
the most significant earthquakes. We can improve this further by using
color to represent magnitudes as well.
Customizing Marker  Colors
We can use Plotly’ s color scales to customize each marker ’s color ,
according to the severity of the corresponding earthquake. We’ll also use a
differe
