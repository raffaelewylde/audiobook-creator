2 ), and
a mar gin below the bottom border ( mb-4 ).
Each item in the list needs the list-group-item  class, and we
customize the default style by removing the border around individual items
❸. The message that’ s displayed when the list is empty needs these same
classes ❹.
When you visit the topics page now , you should see a page with styling that
matches the home page.
Styling the Entries on the Topic Page
On the topic page, we’ll use Bootstrap’ s card component to make each entry
stand out. A card is a nestable set of divs with flexible, predefined styles
that are perfect for displaying a topic’ s entries:
topic.html{% extends 'learning_logs/base.html' %}
❶ {% block page_header %}
  <h1>{{ topic.text }}</h1>
{% endblock page_header %}
{% block content %}
  <p>
    <a href="{% url 'learning_logs:new_entry' topic.i
  </p>
  {% for entry in entries %}
❷     <div class="card mb-3">
      <!-- Card header with timestamp and edit link -
❸       <h4 class="card-header">
        {{ entry.date_added|date:'M d, Y H:i' }}
❹         <small><a href="{% url 'learning_logs:edit_en
          edit entry</a></small>
      </h4>
      <!-- Card body with entry text -->
❺       <div class="card-body">{{ entry.text|linebreaks
    </div>
  {% empty %}
❻     <p>There are no entries for this topic yet.</p>
  {% endfor %}
{% endblock content %}We first place the topic in the page_header  block ❶. Then we delete the
unordered list structure previously used in this template. Instead of making
each entry a list item, we open a div element with the selector card  ❷.
This card has two nested elements: one to hold the timestamp and the link
to edit the entry , and another to hold the body of the entry . The card
selector takes care of most of the styling we need for this div; we customize
the card by adding a small mar gin to the bottom of each card ( mb-3 ).
The first element in the card is a header , which is an <h4>  element with
the selector card-header  ❸. This header contains the date t
