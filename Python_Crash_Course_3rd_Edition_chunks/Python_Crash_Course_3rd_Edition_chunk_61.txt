e the sorted()  function. The sorted()  function lets you display
your list in a particular order , but doesn’ t affect the actual order of the list.
Let’s try this function on the list of cars.
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
❶ print("Here is the original list:")
print(cars)
❷ print("\nHere is the sorted list:")
print(sorted(cars))
❸ print("\nHere is the original list again:")
print(cars)
We first print the list in its original order ❶ and then in alphabetical order
❷. After the list is displayed in the new order , we show that the list is still
stored in its original order ❸:
Here is the original list:
['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']Here is the sorted list:
['audi', 'bmw', 'subaru', 'toyota']
❶ Here is the original list again:
['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
Notice that the list still exists in its original order ❶ after the sorted()
function has been used. The sorted()  function can also accept a
reverse=True  argument if you want to display a list in reverse-
alphabetical order .
NOTE
Sorting a list alphabetically is a bit mor e complicated when all the
values ar e not in lower case. Ther e are several ways to interpr et
capital letters when determining a sort or der, and specifying the
exact or der can be mor e complex than we want to deal with at this
time. However , most appr oaches to sorting will build dir ectly on
what you learned in this section.Printing a List in Reverse Order
To reverse the original order of a list, you can use the reverse()  method.
If we originally stored the list of cars in chronological order according to
when we owned them, we could easily rearrange the list into reverse-
chronological order:
cars = ['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
print(cars)
cars.reverse()
print(cars)
Notice that reverse()  doesn’ t sort backward alphabetically; it simply
reverses the order of the list:
['bmw', 'audi', 'toyota', 'subaru']
['subaru', 'toyota', 'audi', 'bmw']
The reverse()  method changes the order of a list permanently , but
