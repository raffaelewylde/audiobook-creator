ls.py . You should see the
following code:
ll_pr oject/urls.py
❶ from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path
❷ urlpatterns = [
❸     path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
]
The first two lines import the admin  module and a function to build URL
paths ❶. The body of the file defines the urlpatterns  variable ❷. In
this urls.py  file, which defines URLs for the project as a whole, the
urlpatterns  variable includes sets of URLs from the apps in the
project. The list includes the module admin.site.urls , which defines
all the URLs that can be requested from the admin site ❸.
We need to include the URLs for learning_logs , so add the following:
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),    path('', include('learning_logs.urls')),
]
We’ve imported the include()  function, and we’ve also added a line to
include the module learning_logs.urls .
The default urls.py  is in the ll_pr oject folder; now we need to make a
second urls.py  file in the learning_logs folder . Create a new Python file,
save it as urls.py  in learning_logs , and enter this code into it:
learning_logs/urls.py
❶ """Defines URL patterns for learning_logs."""
❷ from django.urls import path
❸ from . import views
❹ app_name = 'learning_logs'
❺ urlpatterns = [
    # Home page
❻     path('', views.index, name='index'),
]To make it clear which urls.py  we’re working in, we add a docstring at the
beginning of the file ❶. We then import the path  function, which is
needed when mapping URLs to views ❷. We also import the views
module ❸; the dot tells Python to import the views.py  module from the
same directory as the current urls.py  module. The variable app_name
helps Django distinguish this urls.py  file from files of the same name in
other apps within the project ❹. The variable urlpatterns  in this
module is a list of individual pages that can be requested from the
learning_logs  app ❺.
The actual URL  pattern is a
