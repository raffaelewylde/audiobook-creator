well on any modern computer . Early setup issues can be
frustrating, but they’re well worth sorting out. Once you get hello_world.py
running, you can start to learn Python, and your programming work will
become more interesting and satisfying.
Running Python Programs from a Terminal
You’ll run most of your programs directly in your text editor . However ,
sometimes it’ s useful to run programs from a terminal instead. For example,you might want to run an existing program without opening it for editing.
You can do this on any system with Python installed if you know how to
access the directory where the program file is stored. To try this, make sure
you’ve saved the hello_world.py  file in the python_work  folder on your
desktop.
On Windows
You can use the terminal command cd, for change dir ectory , to navigate
through your filesystem in a command window . The command dir , for
directory , shows you all the files that exist in the current directory .
Open a new terminal window and enter the following commands to run
hello_world.py :
C:\> cd Desktop\python_work
C:\Desktop\python_work> dir
hello_world.py
C:\Desktop\python_work> python hello_world.py
Hello Python world!
First, use the cd command to navigate to the python_work  folder , which is
in the  Desktop  folder . Next, use the dir  command to make sure
hello_world.py  is in this folder . Then run the file using the command
python hello_world.py .Most of your programs will run fine directly from your editor . However , as
your work becomes more complex, you’ll want to run some of your
programs from a terminal.
On macOS and Linux
Running a Python program from a terminal session is the same on Linux
and macOS. You can use the terminal command cd, for change dir ectory ,
to navigate through your filesystem in a terminal session. The command
ls, for list, shows you all the nonhidden files that exist in the current
directory .
Open a new terminal window and enter the following commands to run
hello_world.py :
~$ cd De
