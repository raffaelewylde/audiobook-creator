should become False  and the
Play button should reappear .
Resetting the Game
The Play button code we just wrote works the first time the player clicks
Play. But it doesn’ t work after the first game ends, because the conditions
that caused the game to end haven’ t been reset.
To reset the game each time the player clicks Play , we need to reset the
game statistics, clear out the old aliens and bullets, build a new fleet, and
center the ship, as shown here:
alien_invasion.py
    def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):
        """Start a new game when the player clicks Pl
        if self.play_button.rect.collidepoint(mouse_p
            # Reset the game statistics.
❶             self.stats.reset_stats()
            self.game_active = True            # Get rid of any remaining bullets and al
❷             self.bullets.empty()
            self.aliens.empty()
            # Create a new fleet and center the ship.
❸             self._create_fleet()
            self.ship.center_ship()
We reset the game statistics ❶, which gives the player three new ships.
Then we set game_active  to True  so the game will begin as soon as
the code in this function finishes running. We empty the aliens  and
bullets  groups ❷, and then we create a new fleet and center the ship ❸.
Now the game will reset properly each time you click Play , allowing you to
play it as many times as you want!
Deactivating the Play Button
One issue with our Play button is that the button region on the screen will
continue to respond to clicks even when the Play button isn’ t visible. If you
click the Play button area by accident after a game begins, the game will
restart!
To fix this, set the game to start only when game_active  is False :alien_invasion.py
    def _check_play_button(self, mouse_pos):
        """Start a new game when the player clicks Pl
❶         button_clicked = self.play_button.rect.collid
❷         if button_clicked and not self.game_active:
            # Reset the game statistics.
