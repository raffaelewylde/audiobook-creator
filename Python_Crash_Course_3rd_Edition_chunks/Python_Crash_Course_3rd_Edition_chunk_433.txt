To update the home page, we’ll use a Bootstrap element called a jumbotr on,
a large box that stands out from the rest of the page. Typically , it’s used on
home pages to hold a brief description of the overall project and a call to

Inside the jumbotron are three elements. The first is a short message,
Track your learning , that gives new visitors a sense of what
Learning Log does ❸. The <h1>  element is a first-level header , and the
display-3  selector adds a thinner and taller look to this particular
