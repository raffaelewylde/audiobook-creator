3-10. Every Function:  Think of things you could store in a list. For example, you could make a
list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else you’d like. Write a
program that creates a list containing these items and then uses each function introduced in this
chapter at least once.Avoiding Index Errors When Working with Lists
There’ s one type of error that’ s common to see when you’re working with
lists for the first time. Let’ s say you have a list with three items, and you ask
for the fourth item:
motor cycles.py
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles[3])
This example results in an index err or:
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "motorcycles.py", line 2, in <module>
    print(motorcycles[3])
          ~~~~~~~~~~~^^^
IndexError: list index out of range
Python attempts to give you the item at index 3. But when it searches the
list, no item in motorcycles  has an index of 3. Because of the of f-by-
one nature of indexing in lists, this error is typical. People think the third
item is item number 3, because they start counting at 1. But in Python the
third item is number 2, because it starts indexing at 0.An index error means Python can’ t find an item at the index you requested.
If an index error occurs in your program, try adjusting the index you’re
asking for by one. Then run the program again to see if the results are
correct.
Keep in mind that whenever you want to access the last item in a list, you
should use the index -1. This will always work, even if your list has
changed size since the last time you accessed it:
motorcycles = ['honda', 'yamaha', 'suzuki']
print(motorcycles[-1])
The index -1 always returns the last item in a list, in this case the value
'suzuki' :
suzuki
The only time this approach will cause an error is when you request the last
item from an empty list:
motorcycles = []
print(motorcycles[-1])
No items are in motorcycles , so Python return
