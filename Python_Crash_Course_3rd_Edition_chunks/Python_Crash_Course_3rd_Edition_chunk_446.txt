❹ (ll_env)learning_log$ git status
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
(ll_env)learning_log$
We issue the git init  command to initialize an empty repository in the
directory containing Learning Log ❶. We then use the git add .
command, which adds all the files that aren’ t being ignored to the
repository ❷. (Don’ t forget the dot.) Next, we issue the command git
commit -am  "commit message ": the -a flag tells Git to include all
changed files in this commit, and the -m flag tells Git to record a log
message ❸.
Issuing the git status  command ❹ indicates that we’re on the main
branch and that our working tree is clean . This is the status you’ll want to
see anytime you push your project to a remote server .
Creating a Pr oject on Platform.sh
At this point, the Learning Log project still runs on our local system and is
also configured to run correctly on a remote server . We’ll use the
Platform.sh CLI to create a new project on the server and then push our
project to the remote server .Make sure you’re in a terminal, at the learning_log/  directory , and issue the
following command:
(ll_env)learning_log$ platform login
Opened URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000
Please use the browser to log in.

❶ Do you want to create an SSH configuration file autom
This command will open a browser tab where you can log in. Once you’re
logged in, you can close the browser tab and return to the terminal. If
you’re prompted about creating an SSH configuration file ❶, enter Y so
you can connect to the remote server later .
Now we’ll create a project. There’ s a lot of output, so we’ll look at the
creation process in sections. Start by issuing the create  command:
(ll_env)learning_log$ platform create
