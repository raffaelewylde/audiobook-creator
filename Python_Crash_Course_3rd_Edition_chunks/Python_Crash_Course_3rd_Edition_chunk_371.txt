ou’r e using PowerShell, you
might need to capitalize Activate .
To stop using a virtual environment, enter deactivate :
(ll_env)learning_log$ deactivate
learning_log$
The environment will also become inactive when you close the terminal it’ s
running in.
Installing Django
With the virtual environment activated, enter the following to update pip
and install Django:
(ll_env)learning_log$ pip install --upgrade pip
(ll_env)learning_log$ pip install django
Collecting django--snip--
Installing collected packages: sqlparse, asgiref, dja
Successfully installed asgiref-3.5.2 django-4.1 sqlpa
(ll_env)learning_log$
Because it downloads resources from a variety of sources, pip is upgraded
fairly often. It’ s a good idea to upgrade pip whenever you make a new
virtual environment.
We’re working in a virtual environment now , so the command to install
Django is the same on all systems. There’ s no need to use longer
commands, such as python -m pip install package_name , or to
include the --user  flag. Keep in mind that Django will be available only
when the ll_env  environment is active.NOTE
Django r eleases a new version about every eight months, so you
may see a newer version when you install Django. This pr oject will
most likely work as it’ s written her e, even on newer versions of
Django. If you want to make sur e to use the same version of Django
you see her e, use the command pip install django==4.1.* .
This will install the latest r elease of Django 4.1. If you have any
issues r elated to the version you’r e using, see the online r esour ces
for this book at https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_3e .
Creating a Pr oject in Django
Without leaving the active virtual environment (remember to look for ll_env
in parentheses in the terminal prompt), enter the following commands to
create a new project:
❶ (ll_env)learning_log$ django-admin startproject ll_pr
❷ (ll_env)learning_log$ ls
ll_env ll_project manage.py
❸ (ll_env)learning_log$ ls ll_project
