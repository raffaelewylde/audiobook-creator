ip , specifies which
third-party package should be updated. The output shows that my current
version of pip, version 22.0.4 ❶, was replaced by the latest version at the
time of this writing, 22.1.2 ❷.
You can use this command to update any third-party package installed on
your system:
$ python -m pip install --upgrade  package_nameNOTE
If you’r e using Linux, pip may not be included with your installation
of Python. If you get an err or when trying to upgrade pip, see the
instructions in Appendix A.
Installing pytest
Now that pip is up to date, we can install pytest :
$ python -m pip install --user pytest
Collecting pytest
  --snip--
Successfully installed attrs-21.4.0 iniconfig-1.1.1 .
We’re still using the core command pip install , without the --
upgrade  flag this time. Instead, we’re using the --user  flag, which tells
Python to install this package for the current user only . The output shows
that the latest version of pytest  was successfully installed, along with a
number of other packages that pytest  depends on.
You can use this command to install many third-party packages:$ python -m pip install --user  package_name
NOTE
If you have any difficulty running this command, try running the
same command without the --user  flag.
Testing a Function
To learn about testing, we need code to test. Here’ s a simple function that
takes in a first and last name, and returns a neatly formatted full name:
name_function.py
def get_formatted_name(first, last):
    """Generate a neatly formatted full name."""
    full_name = f"{first} {last}"
    return full_name.title()
The function get_formatted_name()  combines the first and last name
with a space in between to complete a full name, and then capitalizes andreturns the full name. To check that get_formatted_name()  works,
let’s make a program that uses this function. The program names.py  lets
users enter a first and last name, and see a neatly formatted full name:
names.py
from name_function import get_formatted_name
