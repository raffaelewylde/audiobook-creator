priate messages to users, depending on whether they’re logged in ❷.The block is a little longer now because there are some styling rules inside
the conditional tags. The greeting for authenticated users is wrapped in a
<span>  element ❸. A span element  styles pieces of text or elements of a
page that are part of a longer line. While div elements create their own
divisions in a page, span elements are continuous within a lar ger section.
This can be confusing at first, because many pages have deeply nested div
elements. Here, we’re using the span element to style informational text on
the navigation bar: in this case, the logged-in user ’s name.
In the else  block, which runs for unauthenticated users, we include the
links for registering a new account and logging in ❹. These should look just
like the link to the topics page.
If you wanted to add more links to the navigation bar , you’d add another
<li>  item to one of the <ul>  groups that we’ve defined, using styling
directives like the ones you’ve seen here.
Now let’ s add the logout form to the navigation bar .
Adding the Logout Form to the Navigation Bar
When we first wrote the logout form, we added it to the bottom of
base.html . Now let’ s put it in a better place, in the navigation bar:
base.html        --snip--
        </ul> <!-- End of account-related links -->
        {% if user.is_authenticated %}
          <form action="{% url 'accounts:logout' %}" 
            {% csrf_token %}
❶             <button name='submit' class='btn btn-outl
                Log out</button>
          </form>
        {% endif %}
      </div> <!-- Closes collapsible parts of navbar 
      --snip--
The logout form should be placed after the set of account-related links, but
inside the collapsible section of the navigation bar . The only change in the
form is the addition of a number of Bootstrap styling classes in the
<button>  element, which apply Bootstrap styling elements to the logout
button ❶.
