fining the Navigation Bar
The code that defines the navigation bar at the top of the page is fairly long,
because it has to work equally well on narrow phone screens and wide
desktop monitors. We’ll work through the navigation bar in sections.
Here’ s the first part of the navigation bar:
base.html
--snip--
</head>
<body>❶   <nav class="navbar navbar-expand-md navbar-light bg
    <div class="container-fluid">
❷       <a class="navbar-brand" href="{% url 'learning_
          Learning Log</a>
❸       <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" da

</html>The first new element is the opening <body>  tag. The body  of an HTML
file contains the content users will see on a page. Next we have a <nav>
element, which opens the code for the navigation bar at the top of the page
❶. Everything contained in this element is styled according to the Bootstrap
style rules defined by the selectors navbar , navbar-expand-md , and
the rest that you see here. A selector  determines which elements on a page a
certain style rule applies to. The navbar-light  and bg-light
selectors style the navigation bar with a light-themed background. The mb

selector provides a thin border around the light background to set
